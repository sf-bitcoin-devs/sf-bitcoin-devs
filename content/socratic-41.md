- Questions are encouraged, including basic ones!

- For the privacy of other attendees, please refrain from taking photographs of other people without their permission.
- Socratic seminars are best when the moderator can let the conversation flow, so try to keep things concrete and focused.

- With the impending revival of local Lightning Devs meetups soon, SF Bitcoin Devs will only cover major Lightning news and leave most Lightning discussion for the Lightning Devs meetups
