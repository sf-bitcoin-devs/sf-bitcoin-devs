- [How much entropy is lost alphabetizing your mnemonics?](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113432/how-much-entropy-is-lost-alphabetising-your-mnemonics) - 500 million x speedup for 12 words and getting close to practical, 0.5 septillion for 24 but way beyond feasible. This kind of stuff is interesting, since I think brain wallets where you memorize your passphrase have legitimate uses, for example when in duress, fleeing, imprisoned, etc. So things which modify passphrase generation such that they are easier to memorize, such as alphabetizing them, are worth considering, to answer the question: What is the best way to generate a mnemonic that can be memorized and retain as much entropy as possible? The answer to the question goes deep into some of the math involved. Question for discussion: When is memorizing a passphrase a good idea, if ever?
