  So why does Signature Half Agrregation when used for blockwide signature aggregation in Bitcoin break Adaptor Signatures? Well, we need that untweaked signature  to calculate the secret tweak . But the untweaked signature  is lost inside the aggregate signature . The only thing we have is the tweaked signature , with  and , since those were given to us, but the untweaked signature  should have been revealed when published on-chain. Instead we are given the  which allows us to verify that all inputs inside the block have been signed, but it doesn't allow us to know the exact value of .
  And that's why Signature Half Aggregation breaks Adaptor Signatures.

  Arguably, smart contracts on an alternative chain (e.g., Ethereum) are probably sophisticated enough to implement TxWithhold Smart Contracts in a straightforward way: they indeed could work on Ethereum against Ethereum, and probably could be easily applied to Bitcoin via an Ethereum smart contract tracking Bitcoin SPV state.

  It remains an open question whether these chains could be a good coordination layer for withholdment. Additionally, the model gets much more sophisticated with additional concerns of those chains, e.g. MEV.

  Bitcoin SPV proofs on Ethereum are interesting, bitcoin developers should know about them.


  Since Bitcoin Script does not allow inspecting the UTXO set at transaction validation time, this is impossible today.

  However, a poor protocol design in case of the multi-input transactions could enable this by allowing the attacker to attach inputs to a target transaction. Designers of sophisticated protocols should consider this risk.

  The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.

  Achieving Zero Downtime Splicing in Practice via Chain Signals

  ● Announcing splices: in a PR and a discussion on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, developers discussed the best way to communicate that a channel that was seemingly being closed onchain was in fact a splice where funds were being added to the channel or removed from it.

  One proposal was for nodes to simply not consider a channel closed until some amount of time after its onchain closing transaction was seen. This would give time for the announcement of the new (post-splice) channel to propagate. In the interim, nodes would still attempt to route payments through the seemingly-closed channel, as a spliced channel would still be able to forward payments with full LN security even before its new channel open transaction received a suitable number of confirmations.

  Another proposal was to include a signal onchain as part of the closing transaction that a splice was in progress, telling nodes that they could continue trying to forward payments through it.

The discussion had not come to a clear conclusion at the time this summary was being written.

  Surprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary, peter todd claims. many chime in with much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
  ● Long-term block reward funding: in a thread on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list ostensibly about covenants, it was noted that Bitcoin’s long term security currently depends on demand for block space. That demand must generate transaction fees to pay for Proof of Work (PoW) in excess of what an attacker would be willing to purchase to disrupt Bitcoin users. Developer Peter Todd pointed out that this dependency could be removed if the Bitcoin protocol were modified to include a perpetual subsidy. Several respondents indicated that they thought the system is better off without a perpetual subsidy, while others looked for alternatives or apparent equivalencies such as demurrage.

  As of this writing, the thread appears to consist of casual conversation rather than advocacy for any particular proposal to change Bitcoin in the near future.

  *outocme of this conversation is actually just raliization that we need to encourage block space usage at any cost*

  [Lightning-dev] Onion messages rate-limiting
  ● Onion message rate limiting: Bastien Teinturier posted a summary of an idea he attributes to Rusty Russell for rate limiting onion messages. The proposal has each node store just an extra 32 bytes of information for each of their peers that allows them to Probabilistically punish peers who send too much traffic. The suggested penalty is to just halve the rate limit for a peer relaying too much traffic for about 30 seconds. It’s acceptable if this lightweight penalty is occasionally enforced against the wrong peer, as may happen with this idea. The proposal also allows the originator of a message to learn which downstream nodes are rate limiting their messages (again probabilistically), giving them a chance to resend the message by a different route.

  Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested reconsideration of his previous proposal for preventing abuse of onion messages by charging for data relay, see Newsletter #190. Replies from other developers as of this writing seemed to indicate they first try the lightweight rate limiting to see if it works before adding the complexity of payments for onion messages.

  [Lightning-dev] Three Strategies for Lightning Forwarding Nodes
  ● Fundamental fee-collection strategies for LN forwarding nodes: developer ZmnSCPxj summarized three strategies LN forwarding nodes can use in collecting fees for routing payments (including the strategy of not collecting fees). ZmnSCPxj then analyzes possible outcomes of the different strategies. This seems related to his proposal for nodes to use routing fees to improve payment success rates, see Newsletter #204, which also received significant additional commentary in the past week from Anthony Towns.


● Long-term block reward ongoing discussion: continuing the discussion about reliably paying for Proof of Work (PoW) as Bitcoin’s subsidy declines, two new threads were started on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list:

● Tail emission is not inflationary starts with an argument by Peter Todd that perpetually paying miners with newly created bitcoins will not lead to the number of bitcoins in circulation increasing forever. Instead, he believes some bitcoins will be lost every year and, eventually, the rate at which bitcoins are lost will converge on the rate at which new bitcoins are produced, resulting in a roughly stable number of coins in circulation. He also notes that adding a perpetual block subsidy to Bitcoin would be a hard fork. Quite a few people replied to his post and on a thread about it on BitcoinTalk; we will only attempt to summarize a few replies we found most notable.

● Hard fork not required: Vjudeu suggests that a soft fork can create new bitcoins by imbuing transaction outputs paying zero satoshis with special meaning. For example, when a node opting into the fork sees a zero-sat output, it looks at another part of the transaction for the actual value transferred. This creates two classes of bitcoins, but presumably the soft fork would provide a mechanism to convert legacy-bitcoins to modified-bitcoins. Vjudeu notes the same mechanism could also be used for privacy-enhancing bitcoin amount blinding (e.g. using confidential transactions).

● No reason to believe perpetual issuance is sufficient: Anthony Towns posts to the mailing list and Gregory Maxwell posts to BitcoinTalk that there’s no reason to believe that paying miners an amount of coins equal to the average rate of lost coins will provide sufficient PoW security, and that there are cases where it could overpay for PoW security. If a perpetual issuance can’t guarantee security and if it has a significant likelihood of producing additional problems, it seems preferable to stick with a finite subsidy that—while it also can’t guarantee security—at least it doesn’t produce additional problems and is already accepted by all Bitcoiners (implicitly or explicitly).

Maxwell further notes that Bitcoin miners on average collect significantly more value through just transaction fees than many altcoins pay their miners through the combination of subsidies, fees, and other incentives. Those altcoins are not suffering fundamental PoW attacks, implying that it might be the case that enough value is being paid through transaction fees alone to keep Bitcoin secure. In short, Bitcoin may already be past the point where it needs its subsidy to obtain sufficient PoW security. (Though the subsidy also provides other benefits at present, as discussed in the summary below for Bram Cohen’s thread.)

Towns points out that Peter Todd’s results depend on a constant average rate of bitcoins being lost each year, but this conflicts with what Towns thinks should be a system-wide goal to minimize lost bitcoins. Relatedly, Maxwell describes how coin loss could be almost entirely eliminated by allowing anyone to automatically opt-in to using a script that would donate any of their coins which hadn’t moved for, say, 120 years—well past the expected lifetime of the original owner and their heirs.

● Censorship resistance: developer ZmnSCPxj expanded an argument by Eric Voskuil that transaction fees enhance Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. For example, if 90% of the block reward comes from subsidy and 10% from transaction fees, then the most revenue a censoring miner can lose directly is 10%. But if 90% comes from fees and 10% from subsidy, the miner could directly lose up to 90%—a much stronger incentive to avoid censorship.

Peter Todd countered with the opinion that a perpetual issuance would raise more money for PoW security than “piddling transaction fees”, and that a higher block reward would increase the cost an attacker would have to pay miners to censor transactions.

● Fee sniping: Bram Cohen posted about the problem of fee sniping and suggests keeping transaction fees at about 10% of total block rewards (the remainder being subsidy) as a possible solution. He briefly mentions some other possible solutions, but others provided additional suggestions in more detail.

● Paying fees forward: Russell O’Connor put forward an old idea that miners could calculate the maximum amount of fees they could collect from the top transactions in their mempool without incentivizing fee sniping. They could then offer any additional fees they collected as a bribe to the next miner for building the next block cooperatively rather than competitively. Discussion participants went through several iterations of this idea but Peter Todd noted that a fundamental concern with this technique is that smaller miners would need to pay higher bribes than larger miners, creating economies of scale that could further centralize Bitcoin mining.

● Improving market design: Anthony Towns suggests that improvements in Bitcoin software and user processes could significantly even out fees, making fee sniping less likely. But he further notes that it doesn’t seem like a major priority today just for “refuting some FUD”.
