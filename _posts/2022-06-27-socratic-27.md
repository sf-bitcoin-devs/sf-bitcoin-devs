- Rust lightning and Sensei adds 0-conf channels let's get reckless in this mf https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1401

- http://www.mediumofexchange.info/ - medium_of_exchange hack - social engineering hack, don't use vultr?

- 2022-05-18 - Intentionally triggering a justice transaction - https://fiatjaf.com/73095980.html - fiatjaf has a channel that he wants to close, but it doesn't have many sats on his side, and he doesn't want a small UTXO. So he intentionally broadcasts and old state, so lnbig takes everything in a penalty transaction.

- Degen leveraged Lightning trading, never more bullish on lightning. Logged in to a degenerate exchange, blocked from trading because US IP address, bought time on Mullvad VPN with Lightning, refreshed page with Albanian IP, went 20x long on Bitcoin w/50k sats, paid with lightning, limit order filled, withdrew 60k sats. All transactions instant and low fee.

- 2022-04-24 - How much entropy is lost alphabetizing your mnemonics? - https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113432/how-much-entropy-is-lost-alphabetising-your-mnemonics - 500 million x speedup for 12 words and getting close to practical, 0.5 septillion for 24 but way beyond feasible. Kind of thing this stuff is interesting, since I think brain wallets where you memorize your passphrase have legitimate uses, for example when in duress, fleeing, imprisoned, etc. So things which modify passphrase generation such that they are easier to memorize, such as alphabetizing them, are worth considering, to answer the question: What is the best way to generate a mnemonic that can be memorized and retain as much entropy as possible? The answer to the question goes deep into some of the math involved. Question for discussion: When is memorizing a passphrase a good idea, if ever?
