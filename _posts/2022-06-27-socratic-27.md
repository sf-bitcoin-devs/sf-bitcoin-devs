- 2022-04-24 - How much entropy is lost alphabetizing your mnemonics? - https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113432/how-much-entropy-is-lost-alphabetising-your-mnemonics - 500 million x speedup for 12 words and getting close to practical, 0.5 septillion for 24 but way beyond feasible. Kind of thing this stuff is interesting, since I think brain wallets where you memorize your passphrase have legitimate uses, for example when in duress, fleeing, imprisoned, etc. So things which modify passphrase generation such that they are easier to memorize, such as alphabetizing them, are worth considering, to answer the question: What is the best way to generate a mnemonic that can be memorized and retain as much entropy as possible? The answer to the question goes deep into some of the math involved. Question for discussion: When is memorizing a passphrase a good idea, if ever?

- 2022-04-27 - How do PBSTs indicate the taproot signing method? - https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113489/taproot-signing-with-psbt-how-to-determine-signing-method - There are three ways to produce a valid Schnoor signature in taproot. How does a BPST indicate to the signer which should be used? guggero asks and guesses, Andrew Chow answers and confirms.

- 2022-05-06 - The Waste Metric - https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113622/what-does-waste-metric-mean-in-the-context-of-coin-selection - Murch discusses the waste metric, a simple metric for coin selection which tries to capture coin-selection goals in a way that is sensitive to the current market, relative to expected long-term fee market.

- 2022-05-16 - Bitcoin Core PR: Pre-segwit compact block relay is dropped, leaving only segwit compact block relay - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20799

- 2022-05-18 - Intentionally triggering a justice transaction - https://fiatjaf.com/73095980.html - fiatjaf has a channel that he wants to close, but it doesn't have many sats on his side, and he doesn't want a small UTXO. So he intentionally broadcasts and old state, so lnbig takes everything in a penalty transaction.

- 2022-05-20 - Why isn't `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` compatible with batch verification of schnorr signatures? - https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113816/why-isnt-op-checkmultisig-compatible-with-batch-verification-of-schnorr-signa - Because OP_CHECKMULTISIG doesn't tell you which keys are being skipped, so it has to try all permitted combinations of keys, which wouldn't work with batch verification, which doesn't give any indication of which signatures failed.

- Degen leveraged Lightning trading, never more bullish on lightning. Logged in to a degenerate exchange, blocked from trading because US IP address, bought time on Mullvad VPN with Lightning, refreshed page with Albanian IP, went 20x long on Bitcoin w/50k sats, paid with lightning, limit order filled, withdrew 60k sats. All transactions instant and low fee.
