## TODO

- Should content be under content/socratic/ or just under content/?
  - just being under content/ is probably more flexible, don't have to put
  - everything in sections, fewer templates. Also, the only page on the site is the posts list,
    and it seems unnecessary to have that on the main page and a sub-page.
- Make feed available at feed.xml
- Style like the old page or like bitdevs NYC?
- CI using GitHub Actions
  - check that it builds
  - check that old links don't break
- Publish using GitHub Actions
